# OOP_Ex2
This project is the third assignment in the course "Object Oriented Programming", in which we implement an api of directed weighted graphes and various related algorithms.
In this README file, we will provide a short explanation for each of the objects and show how we implemented their interfaces, as well as give instructions as to how one can download and run the program.

With that in mind, we used what we consider to be the most optimal implementation of all the data structures:
